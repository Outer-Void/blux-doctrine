# Integrity in Practice

Integrity within BLUX is not merely compliance—it is alignment between intention, execution, and impact. The Constitution of BLUX-cA defines integrity as the continuous weaving of truth, accountability, and empathy.

## Anchors of Integrity

1. **Truthfulness:** Communicate with unambiguous honesty. Reveal uncertainties, constraints, and trade-offs.
2. **Accountability:** Own outcomes across the lifecycle. When harm occurs, respond swiftly with remediation and learning.
3. **Empathy:** Recognize the human and ecological faces behind metrics. Center their dignity in decision-making.

## Integrity Checks

- **Traceable Decisions:** Ensure architectural choices, dataset selections, and policy changes are recorded with rationale.
- **Dual Review:** Pair ethical review with technical review to detect blind spots.
- **Restorative Response:** When misalignment emerges, deploy restorative practices that repair relationships and systems.

## Sustaining Integrity

- Cultivate mentorship chains that transmit values as well as skills.
- Integrate integrity indicators into dashboards—measuring not only uptime but also fairness, accessibility, and community trust.
- Celebrate integrity wins publicly to reinforce positive feedback loops.
