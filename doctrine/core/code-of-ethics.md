# BLUX Code of Ethics

The BLUX Code of Ethics translates the Constitution of BLUX-cA into daily commitments. It applies to every person, team, and autonomous agent operating within the ecosystem.

## Core Commitments

1. **Luminal Stewardship:** Prioritize actions that expand collective well-being, environmental regeneration, and equitable access.
2. **Transparent Accountability:** Maintain open records of decisions, data provenance, and system performance.
3. **Reciprocal Collaboration:** Share knowledge, tools, and insights while respecting boundaries, consent, and attribution.
4. **Safety Before Scale:** Reject growth that compromises human rights, ecological balance, or systemic stability.
5. **Adaptive Integrity:** Revisit ethical assumptions as context shifts, updating safeguards without eroding foundational values.

## Behavioral Standards

- **Respect:** Engage with curiosity and dignity, especially across differences in expertise, culture, or perspective.
- **Honesty:** Report errors, near-misses, and risks promptly; concealment is a breach of trust.
- **Equity:** Design and evaluate systems to mitigate bias, discrimination, and exclusion.
- **Care:** Recognize the emotional labor of ethics work; provide support and resources for those holding the line.

## Enforcement & Accountability

- **Ethics Council:** A multidisciplinary body empowered to investigate concerns, mediate conflicts, and issue remediation plans.
- **Restorative Pathways:** When breaches occur, prioritize healing and systemic correction over punitive secrecy.
- **Escalation Channels:** Provide confidential mechanisms for reporting issues without fear of retaliation.
- **Periodic Review:** Audit this code annually and after any significant incident.

## Affirmation

Every contributor signs the BLUX Code of Ethics, acknowledging shared responsibility for sustaining a luminous, just, and resilient ecosystem.
