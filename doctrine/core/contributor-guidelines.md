# Contributor Guidelines

These guidelines help contributors honor the Constitution of BLUX-cA while advancing the BLUX Doctrine. Follow them for every proposal, code change, dataset contribution, and narrative update.

## 1. Preparation

- **Study the Core:** Read the Outer-Void Manifest & AI Unity synthesis and accompanying essays before contributing.
- **Declare Intent:** Document the desired impact, affected stakeholders, and anticipated risks in a contribution brief.
- **Assemble Allies:** Identify co-reviewers spanning engineering, ethics, design, and community domains.

## 2. Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork with Purpose:** Ensure your working branch references the doctrine component being updated and states the light you aim to extend.
2. **Design for Auditability:** Keep commits small, reversible, and richly described. Attach context, test results, and ethical considerations.
3. **Engage in Transparent Review:** Invite feedback early; respond to questions with evidence, humility, and gratitude.
4. **Finalize with Reflection:** Upon merge, record lessons and outstanding questions in the Light Ledger.

## 3. Community Norms

- **Uphold the Code of Ethics:** Apply the ethical commitments to your process and interactions.
- **Respect Consent:** Obtain approval before sharing sensitive data, user stories, or partner information.
- **Lift Marginalized Voices:** Prioritize inclusion of perspectives historically excluded from decision-making.
- **Steward Resources:** Use computational, financial, and human resources responsibly, avoiding wasteful experiments.

## 4. Governance Alignment

- **Constitutional Check:** Validate that contributions align with BLUX-cA principles—luminal stewardship, transparent accountability, reciprocal collaboration, safety before scale, and adaptive integrity.
- **Guardian Escalation:** If conflicts arise, consult the Ethics Council or governance guardians before proceeding.
- **Versioning Protocol:** Tag doctrine releases with semantic versions and maintain changelogs for traceability.

## 5. Ongoing Commitments

- Participate in quarterly Unity Councils to coordinate efforts.
- Mentor newcomers, transmitting both technical and ethical knowledge.
- Propose improvements to these guidelines when new insights emerge.
